A simple layout of what you want and where you want to place the things on your web page.\n   wire-frame server various purposes:\n   1. Scalability and flexibility: It is easy to update a web site using wire frames.\n   For example: If initially your web site is offering 5 products but in few months the production increases to say 50. In these cases wire frames identify the area to update without disturbing other architecture of a web site.\n   2. Clarification: Using wire frames first gives a clear idea of how a site should look, what a client wants, where the text will be placed etc.\n   3. Saves time: Using wire frames before the actual site development can save a lot of time. It gives the idea of what a client is looking in a site, so client's feedback before site development can be useful.\n   4. Quick and Cheap: Making these layouts are easy, it can be made even with pen and paper. \n   5. Painless Iterations: Creating wire frames using software makes the iteration process much easy.\n")])])]),t("h2",{attrs:{id:"_2-what-are-the-different-levels-of-detail-in-wire-frames-and-why-is-each-one-useful"}},[t("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#_2-what-are-the-different-levels-of-detail-in-wire-frames-and-why-is-each-one-useful"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" 2.

Mid-fidelity wire frames: At this level, a more specific idea of how a web site should be is provided. A bit of scaling and more clear idea navigation are provided, but still avoid some more specific details like photo or text.\n  3.
