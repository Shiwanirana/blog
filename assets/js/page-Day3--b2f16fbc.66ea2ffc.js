Inferential(Blind)--\x3e These depend on the response and behavioral patterns of the server so are slow.\n  Boolean: In response of the attacker's query the server send a response in true or false manner.\n  Time-based: In this there is a wait in response from the server, and the attacker can see from the time that the response to be true or false.\n  3.
