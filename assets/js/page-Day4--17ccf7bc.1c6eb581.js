So on wednesday night, at home i did both the modals for adding the vaults and keeps and by clicking on the vaults, on vault page i was getting the vault with all its keeps. But my main challenge was to delete the relationship. So i knew i need a vault keep id, and it was deleting the relationship easily, but it was not instant, i needed to refresh every time i deleted a vaultkeep to see the page. Then got the point that after the deletion i need to give that page all the remaining keeps of that particular vault by its vaultId. That day also i retested my backend and got one error, researched a lot, it was saying null-reference error, changed a few things and then after taking help found my mistake. By the end of the day i submitted my project and was evaluated and luckily  passed the final project with one thing left, the masonry thing, which i actually tried but then deleted, because i was not getting the required results.")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("Final Project: Keeper")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=i.exports}}]);
